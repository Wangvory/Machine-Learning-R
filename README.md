# Machine-Learning-R
 
## Introduction to Big Data
We start our big data adventure by making a business case for big data. Why is this important and why study data-driven decision making. What tools are available and how is business accommodating the relatively new field of big data analysis.
## Organizing and Managing Data
We look at the different types of data. Also, we look to understand how data can be stored, read, updated and deleted in a systematic fashion. Businesses use relational databases and SQL to capture their data. We will work extensively with Teradata to understand how data can be normalized and retrieved efficiently for business use.
## Data Analysis and Visualization
We delve into the world of technologies used for analyzing data. We will concentrate on R and RStudio for looking at statistical measures of data as well as data visualization. Scripts will be developed to build a library of scripts. Statistical measures of data will be discussed, presented, and then shown in R.
## Prediction and Classification Methods
We look at various predictive performance measures as well as prediction and classification methods used in data analysis. The intent is to build both a technical and intuitive understanding of data analysis. Example datasets will be discussed for domain knowledge and various machine learning techniques will be discussed. A theoretical treatise of how machine learning techniques work will be discussed with accompanying papers.
## Case Studies in Big Data
Students and the instructor will present their Projects to the entire class for discussion of the data analysis process and the conclusions of the data analysis.
